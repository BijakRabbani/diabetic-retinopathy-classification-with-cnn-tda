# Diabetic Retinopathy Classification using Convolutional Neural Network and Topological Data Analysis

This project focuses on building a model to classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy using fundus images. We employ a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based on the **ResNet architecture** and incorporate additional features derived from **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** to improve classification accuracy.

The dataset used is the [APTOS Kaggle Blindness Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection), which provides labeled images of retinas with varying levels of diabetic retinopathy.

Additionally, the project includes a **dashboard** that enables users to upload images and get predictions on the severity of diabetic retinopathy.
